This splashscreen video/image combination is based off the work of Rookervik on the [RetroPie](https://blog.petrockblock.com/forums/topic/ultimate-video-splash-screen/) forums.

I have simply replaced the first few seconds of the video as a still frame so it lines up with the image. The way it works is the image loads first, then the video plays once it able to (it waits for DBUS). The transition is pretty smooth, a small flicker between them. This is mainly for a Raspberry Pi Zero because it can take upwards of 10 seconds before the video starts.

I claim no copyright on this.
